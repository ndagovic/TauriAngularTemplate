# TauriAngularTemplate
A simple template starter repo with tauri + angular

# Purpose

I didnt find any templates for Tauri + Angular so here it is. Latest Bulma and PrimeNG integrated (check versions just in case)

There is also a possibility that I am blind and didnt see something staring me in the face.

Reloading enabled by default
If you edit the Angular part - localhost:4200 is reloaded normally,
If you edit the Tauri/Rust part - app gets recompiled and relaunched.

# Spooder for good luck
